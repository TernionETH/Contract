We are adding new functions, which raises the security of Ternion and makes the process even more transparent.
Some old functions which were non efficient were deleted or replaced.

The code optimisated for work with the version of the new compilator - solidity 0.4.24:
- Fixed work with scope of functions
- Fixed types of return values
- Fixed work with event elements

- A library for safe mathematical functions is connected (https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol) and the internal work of the contract is optimized
 Functions not carrying semantic loading are excluded
